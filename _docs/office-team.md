Office team
===========

We have an office team of 3 etéreotypes, plus some extra staff that are pulled in when needed. The office team does most of the non-consulting work needed to run the day to day operations.

Things like:

-   Course and event administration (setting up registration pages, handling customer inquiries, sending emails, etc).
-   Organize the bi-annual [etéreo unconference](unconference.html).

These are just a few examples, not a complete list. The office team does *a lot* of stuff!
